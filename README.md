# African ♥️ This App
## Mod 3 Solo Project
[Heather Faerber](https://github.com/hfaerber)  

This application uses the Fetch API to retrieve data about African countries,
cleans the data down to country names, capital cities, and regions then displays
the information on study cards.  Users can either study the map of Africa or
study these study cards.  Users can mark when they have committed a card's
information to memory and can filter to only display cards they still need to
learn, cards they've mastered, or all cards. Users can also search by country
name.

## Set Up
Clone this repo to your local machine.  Run `npm install` to install
dependencies.  

To launch the application, run `npm start` in your terminal.  
Go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.    
Type control + c in your terminal to stop running the application locally.  

## Technologies
This application was built with `create-react-app` and tested with Jest and
Enzyme.  

The project focused on:
- Clean, modular React architecture
- Redux implementation for global state management
- Accessing data using the Fetch API
- Effective project management and workflow through the use of GitHub Projects
- Thorough test coverage with a robust test suite that includes snapshot, unit,
async and redux testing

## Future Iterations
Future iterations would add features to allow users to search by capital city
and to filter by region.  A quiz or quizzes to test user's learning would be
added as well.
